# AI-Algorithms-College-Course

This repository contains implementations of various algorithms covered in the Artificial Intelligence course at my College. 

The algorithms are categorized as follows:

## Uninformed (Blind) Search  
- **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**  
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**  
- **Depth-Limited Search (DLS)**  
- **Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)**  

## Informed (Heuristic) Search  
- **Greedy Best-First Search**  
- **A* Search**  
- **Recursive Best-First Search**
